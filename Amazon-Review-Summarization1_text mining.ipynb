    "# Abstractive Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization is a text summarization technique that generates a concise summary by creating new sentences that convey the main ideas of the original text. Unlike extractive summarization, which directly selects sentences or phrases from the source text, abstractive methods aim to produce summaries that are closer to how a human might summarize, often rephrasing or synthesizing information.\n",
    "Some of its key features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative Approach:** Abstractive summarization involves generating new text that captures the essence of the input while using different phrasing and sentence structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Understanding:** Advanced models analyze the text to understand its overall meaning and produce coherent summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** This method allows for the integration of knowledge, inference, and rephrasing, making it suitable for summarizing complex and varied content."
